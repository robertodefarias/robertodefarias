# Roberto de Farias | Web Development • AI Applications • Digital Marketing

# 👋 Hi, I'm Roberto de Farias

I was born in Brazil and I am also a Canadian citizen, open to professional opportunities in **Canada**, **Brazil**, and **remote-first roles worldwide**.  
I am also **fully open to relocation across Europe**, excited to contribute to multicultural teams and embrace new challenges.  
Fluent in **English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish**, I am always willing to learn **new languages** when needed.

I value **remote work** for the focus and productivity it brings, while also appreciating **on-site collaboration** for the strong professional connections and networking it creates.  
This balance allows me to dedicate my best energy to projects while continuing to grow through ongoing studies and specialization.

I am the founder of my own international brand, scaled to 40,000+ students and clients in 26 countries.  
I built everything myself — from branding and marketing strategy to full-stack digital platforms.  
This experience gave me a solid foundation in both **technology** and **business growth**.

Now, my goal is to **transition from entrepreneur to full-time contributor** within a forward-looking company, channeling my experience, discipline, and innovation mindset into a team environment.
