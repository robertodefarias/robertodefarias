# Roberto de Farias | Web Development • AI Applications • Digital Marketing

# 👋 Hi, I'm Roberto de Farias

I was born in Brazil and I’m also a Canadian citizen, open to professional opportunities both in **Canada** and **Brazil** — as well as **remote-first roles worldwide**.  
In addition, I am **100% open to relocation across Europe**, excited to embrace new cultures, environments, and challenges.  
Fluent in **English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish**, I thrive in multicultural settings and I’m also open to learning **new languages** if required.

I am open to both **remote-first roles** and **on-site opportunities**.  
I value remote work because it allows me to dedicate my best energy to projects, avoid unnecessary commuting stress, and continue specializing through ongoing studies.  
At the same time, I also appreciate **in-person collaboration**, since it strengthens professional relationships, fosters team synergy, and expands networking opportunities.

I am the founder of my own international brand, scaled to 40,000+ students and clients in 26 countries.  
I built everything myself — from branding and marketing strategy to full-stack digital platforms.  
This experience gave me a strong foundation not only in **technology** but also in **business growth and user-centered solutions**.

While I am proud of this entrepreneurial journey, my current goal is to **transition from entrepreneur to full-time contributor within a forward-looking company**.  
This is not about abandoning my project, but about **channeling my experience, discipline, and innovation mindset** into a team environment — helping an organization grow while continuing to expand my expertise in technology.

Currently, I am focusing on **Web Development and Artificial Intelligence** to create innovative digital solutions that merge **technology + user-centered design** for personal and business transformation.
