# Roberto de Farias | Web Development • AI Applications • Digital Marketing

# 👋 Hi, I'm Roberto de Farias

Founder of my own international brand, scaled to 40,000+ students and clients in 26 countries.  
I built everything myself — from branding and marketing strategy to full-stack digital platforms.  
This experience gave me a strong foundation not only in **technology** but also in **business growth and user-centered solutions**.

While I am proud of this entrepreneurial journey, my current goal is to **transition from entrepreneur to full-time contributor within a forward-looking company**.  
This is not about abandoning my project, but about **channeling my experience, discipline, and innovation mindset** into a team environment — helping an organization grow while continuing to expand my expertise in technology.

Currently, I am focusing on **Web Development and Artificial Intelligence** to create innovative digital solutions that merge **technology + self-knowledge** for personal and business transformation.
